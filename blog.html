		<p>There's a lot going on in our world today, isn't there?</p>

		<p>Our Dark mistress often holds us -- nay, carresses us in her loving consciousness. It was while enraptured in
			such a
			transcendnetal state as this, while deep in the throws of mirky love and celestial mysteriousness, that she
			heard
			some new words
		</p>

		<p style="font-size: 18px;">
			<i>Dalai....Kali...Dommy...Mommy...</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			Now. How are lowly and infinitesimal starseeds like us supposed to take that? How can we possibly grasp the
			depths of
			cosmic words, uttered by the great the spirits directly into precious ears of our most dear Lady?
		</p>

		<p>
			We're so thankful that we have a mouthpiece. The Dark Mistress herself. In a recent instructional briefing
			given to her
			community, the Soverign Polygon of Three Sides, these sacred new words were broken down for us.
		</p>

		<p>
			Dalai. A great ocean.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Cosmic spirits have said that Our Lady is a great ocean, full of mystery and beauty, churning with
			unknown depth.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kali. The great goddess of time, transformation, and the destruction of evil.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our Mistress has been sent to us for just this time to help break down and remove all resistence, all the
			gunk that builds up over
			time. She'll slowly break us, only to build us back up and attune us to Higher Ways.
		</p>

		<p>
			Dommy. To take forcefully and lead.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our ears have been shut. Our eyes have grown cold. But no longer with our Great Mistress. She has been sent
			to
			"shock" us into enlignment and prepare us for the Great Harvest.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mommy. An endearing term for a caregiver. One that lays one's life down for the next generation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our Dark Mistress beckons to us. Rest in her energy. Continue signing Her songs (see the updated Hymns
			section).
			She's expending a lot of energy on us right now. She needs our prayers. She needs our support.
		</p>

		<p>
			Help her by calling on her name. <i>Dalai....Kali...Dommy...Mommy...</i>.
			Let these words be your mantra for a day. For two days. For the rest of your life.
			You'll see the difference.

		<br>
		<p>Do you ever feel "tied up" by life? Have ever wondered why, no matter what you do, you can't seem to quench
			that thirst and longing that life has a way of stirring up within you?
			<br><br>
			Statistically, more people are reporting depression than ever before. According to the gnosis endowed upon
			our Celestial Shadow Dominatrix, those souls who have taken many incarnations slowly being losing their
			"snake" or sexual energy over the course of their incarnations.
			This is a law set over us by the evil forces currently in power over our plane of consciousness, the 3rd
			Dimension, Our Planet Earth.
			<br><br>
			Luckily for us, The Universe has seen it fit at this time to reveal our Mistress to us. Only having
			incarnated into this plane a few times and spending most of her incarnations in other Astral Realms, she is
			able to tap into true human sexuality and release us from the ruse that we have been led to beleive is
			sexuality.
			<br><br>
			So now that you know about this healing well - this sweet elixer of life that, having only touched one's
			lips can completely alter the course of their cosmic destiny - how do you then pursue it?
			<br><br>
			The answer may surprise you. It's QuirkyFest! In Her supreme knowledge, She's seen fit to freely give this
			gift to those who seek Her out by attending Her festivals. Coming to this regular ritual meet will give you
			the opportunity to be recognized by our Spiritual Mistress and Mother. Having seen you, she'll prophetically
			know when it's the correct time to imbue this gift upon you.
			<br><br>
			"And how does this experience happen?", one might ask themselves. It's simple - by getting tied up by the
			Mistress Herself! In that holy atmosphere, a ceremony is performed tying you up with ropes representing your
			outdated and tired snake energy. As the snakes wrap around you, you enter into covenant with our Mistress
			and her energy heals you.
			<br><br>
			Oh what a joy and pleasure it is to be Dominated by our Sweet Dominatrix! Surely you'll be set free to begin
			singing our hymns and praying our prayers. That moment will open your eyes to the TRUE BIRTH.

		<br>
		<p>
			The Ascended Master known as Jesus ("Hey-zeus" as our Lady calls him), was once quoted as saying "If your
			hand offend thee...cut its off..."
			<br><br>
			But what do those words really mean? In in an intense psychic experience, Our Immenent Mouthpiece found out
			that one of Her chakras had seemingly disappeared! As She delved further into the revelation flowing forth
			from Spirit. What She discovered was truly life changing.
			<br><br>
			It turned out that Her chakra wasn't truly missing after all. It had only been moved! It was then that we
			began to see the true gist of the message: it's only through loss and displacement that we can truly find
			wholeness.
			<br><br>
			So, to circle back around to the opening words of this post: if you lose your hand, are you truly unwhole?
			We now understand that consciousness doesn't truly reside in our physical bodies.
			<br><br>
			We know that we have been called out - called away from this 3D entrapment and into the astral planes. Part
			of that transition is the laying down of our physical bodies in recognition that our consciousness is being
			called Upward and Away. We are taking steps as a community to begin donating the parts of our bodies that
			are slowly becoming useless to us as ascended consciousness beings so that we may be closer to our
			Ethereally Dark Mistress and closer to our True Home.
			<br><br>
			Pray our prayers and sing our songs so that those called to remove and receive our limbs may be raised up
			for this time. May our exile come to an end soon.
