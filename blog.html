<p>Do you ever feel "tied up" by life? Have ever wondered why, no matter what you do, you can't seem to quench that thirst and longing that life has a way of stirring up within you?
<br><br>
Statistically, more people are reporting depression than ever before. According to the gnosis endowed upon our Celestial Shadow Dominatrix, those souls who have taken many incarnations slowly being losing their "snake" or sexual energy over the course of their incarnations.
This is a law set over us by the evil forces currently in power over our plane of consciousness, the 3rd Dimension, Our Planet Earth.
<br><br>
Luckily for us, The Universe has seen it fit at this time to reveal our Mistress to us. Only having incarnated into this plane a few times and spending most of her incarnations in other Astral Realms, she is able to tap into true human sexuality and release us from the ruse that we have been led to beleive is sexuality.
<br><br>
So now that you know about this healing well - this sweet elixer of life that, having only touched one's lips can completely alter the course of their cosmic destiny - how do you then pursue it?
<br><br>
The answer may surprise you. It's QuirkyFest! In Her supreme knowledge, She's seen fit to freely give this gift to those who seek Her out by attending Her festivals. Coming to this regular ritual meet will give you the opportunity to be recognized by our Spiritual Mistress and Mother. Having seen you, she'll prophetically know when it's the correct time to imbue this gift upon you.
<br><br>
"And how does this experience happen?", one might ask themselves. It's simple - by getting tied up by the Mistress Herself! In that holy atmosphere, a ceremony is performed tying you up with ropes representing your outdated and tired snake energy. As the snakes wrap around you, you enter into covenant with our Mistress and her energy heals you.
<br><br>
Oh what a joy and pleasure it is to be Dominated by our Sweet Dominatrix! Surely you'll be set free to begin singing our hymns and praying our prayers. That moment will open your eyes to the TRUE BIRTH.

<br>
<p>
	The Ascended Master known as Jesus ("Hey-zeus" as our Lady calls him), was once quoted as saying "If your hand offend thee...cut it off..."
	<br><br>
	But what do those words really mean? In in an intense psychic experience, Our Immenent Mouthpiece found out that one of Her chakras had seemingly disappeared! As She delved further into the revelation flowing forth from Spirit. What She discovered was truly life changing.
	<br><br>
	It turned out that Her chakra wasn't truly missing after all. It had only been moved! It was then that we began to see the true gist of the message:  it's only through loss and displacement that we can truly find wholeness.
	<br><br>
	So, to circle back around to the opening words of this post: if you lose your hand, are you truly unwhole? We now understand that consciousness doesn't truly reside in our physical bodies.
	<br><br>
	We know that we have been called out - called away from this 3D entrapment and into the astral planes. Part of that transition is the laying down of our physical bodies in recognition that our consciousness is being called Upward and Away. We are taking steps as a community to begin donating the parts of our bodies that are slowly becoming useless to us as ascended consciousness beings so that we may be closer to our Ethereally Dark Mistress and closer to our True Home.
	<br><br>
	Pray our prayers and sing our songs so that those called to remove and receive our limbs may be raised up for this time. May our exile come to an end soon.
