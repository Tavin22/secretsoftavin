<p>One reads the word "cult" and immediately gets images related to Kool-Aide and Remote Compounds. But that's not really what we are.
<br>
So why come out and refer to ourselves as a cult on the front page of our webstie? Because it's what our Dark Mistress bids. She encourages us to show up every day with our most authentic selves and not deny who we really are.
<br>
The term "cult" is really short for "culture". And that's what we are: a culture of people who have karmically tied themselves to our Maiden of the Celestial Shadows in order to search out true freedom from the 3D.
<br>
We are an open community - providing access to the life changing energies that our Lady channels for us.
